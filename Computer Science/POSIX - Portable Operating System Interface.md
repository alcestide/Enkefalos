POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) is a set of standard operating system interfaces based on the [Unix](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatacenter/definition/Unix) operating system. The most recent POSIX specifications -- IEEE Std 1003.1-2017 -- defines a standard interface and environment that can be used by an operating system ([OS](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/operating-system-OS)) to provide access to POSIX-compliant applications. The standard also defines a command interpreter ([shell](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatacenter/definition/shell)) and common [utility](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/utility) programs. POSIX supports application [portability](https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/definition/portability) at the [source code](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/source-code) level so applications can be built to run on any POSIX-compliant OS.
[Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) suggested the name _POSIX_ to the IEEE instead of former _IEEE-IX_. The committee found it more easily pronounceable and memorable, and thus adopted it.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX#cite_note-RMS-5)
Over the years, the POSIX specifications have continued to be revised and reorganized. At one time, each standard was informally named POSIX, followed by a decimal and then the standard's number. For example, POSIX.1 was the standard for an application programming interface in the [C](https://www.techtarget.com/searchwindowsserver/definition/C) language, and POSIX.2 was the standard shell and utility interface for the OS. These standards were officially named IEEE Std 1003.1 and IEEE Std 1003.2, respectively.
