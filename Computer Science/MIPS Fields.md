■ _op:_ Basic operation of the instruction, traditionally called the **opcode**.

■ _rs:_ The first register source operand.

■ _rt:_ The second register source operand.

■ _rd:_ The register destination operand. It gets the result of the operation.

■ _shamt:_ Shift amount. (Section 2.6 explains shift instructions and this term; it will not be used until then, and hence the field contains zero in this section.)

■ _funct:_ Function. This field, often called the _function code_, selects the specific variant of the operation in the op field.
