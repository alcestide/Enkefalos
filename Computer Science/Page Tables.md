A ****Page Table**** is a data structure used by the operating system to keep track of the mapping between virtual addresses used by a process and the corresponding physical addresses in the systemâ€™s memory.

A Page Table Entry (PTE) is an entry in the Page Table that stores information about a particular page of memory. Each PTE contains information such as the physical address of the page in memory, whether the page is present in memory or not, whether it is writable or not, and other access permissions.

The size and format of a PTE can vary depending on the architecture of the system and the operating system used. In general, a PTE contains enough information to allow the operating system to manage memory efficiently and protect the system from malicious or accidental access to memory.
