MLFQ scheduling divides processes into multiple queues based on their priority levels. However, unlike MLQ scheduling, processes can move between queues based on their behavior and needs.

**Priorities adjusted dynamically:** The priority of a process can be adjusted dynamically based on its behavior, such as how much CPU time it has used or how often it has been blocked. Higher-priority processes are given more CPU time and lower-priority processes are given less.

**Time-slicing:** Each queue is assigned a time quantum or time slice, which determines how much CPU time a process in that queue is allowed to use before it is preempted and moved to a lower priority queue.

**Feedback mechanism:** MLFQ scheduling uses a feedback mechanism to adjust the priority of a process based on its behavior over time. For example, if a process in a lower-priority queue uses up its time slice, it may be moved to a higher-priority queue to ensure it gets more CPU time.

**Preemption:** Preemption is allowed in MLFQ scheduling, meaning that a higher-priority process can preempt a lower-priority process to ensure it gets the CPU time it needs.
