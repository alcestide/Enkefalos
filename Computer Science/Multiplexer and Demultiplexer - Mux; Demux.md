A **multiplexer**, also known as **data selector**, is a device that selects between several analog or digital input signals and forwards the selected input to a single output line. 
onversely, a **demultiplexer** (or **demux**) is a device taking a single input and selecting signals of the output of the compatible **mux**, which is connected to the single input, and a shared selection line.
A multiplexer is often used with a complementary demultiplexer on the receiving end. Often, a multiple xer and demultiplexer are combined into a single piece of equipment, which is simply referred to as a _multiplexer_. Both circuit elements are needed at both ends of a transmission link because most communications systems transmit in both directions.
An electronic **multiplexer** can be considered as a **multiple-input, single-output switch,** and a **demultiplexer** as a **single-input, multiple-output switch.** 
The schematic symbol for a multiplexer is an **isosceles** **trapezoid** with the longer parallel side containing the input pins and the short parallel side containing the output pin.

The basic function of a multiplexer: **combining** **multiple** inputs into a **single** data stream. On the receiving side, a demultiplexer **splits** the single data stream into the original **multiple** signals.
