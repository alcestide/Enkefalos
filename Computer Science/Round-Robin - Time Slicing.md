Round-robin scheduling (FigureÂ 7.151) allocates each task an equal share of the CPU time. 
In its simplest form, tasks are in a circular queue and when a task's allocated CPU time expires, the task is put to the end of the queue and the new task is taken from the front of the queue. Round-robin scheduling is not very satisfactory in many real-time applications where each task can have varying amounts of CPU requirements depending upon the complexity of processing required. 
One variation of the pure round-robin scheduling is to provide priority-based scheduling, where tasks with the same priority levels receive equal amounts of CPU time. It is also possible to allocate different maximum CPU times to each task. An example project is given later on the use of round-robin scheduling.
