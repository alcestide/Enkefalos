1 - Think about the reason you should be doing it

2 - Modify it - listen to a podcast or something fun

3 - Mindset shift - I don&rsquo;t have to do this, I get to do this

4 - Add a nice activity after

5 - Think about your role models, you don&rsquo;t want to disappoint them

6 - If it&rsquo;s really impossible to stick to your plan - do just a little. A little is better than nothing.

So far, my most effective method is giving myself a pep talk and setting a timer for 15 minutes.

&ldquo;Okay you gotta work on this it&rsquo;s due tomorrow. Let&rsquo;s put in 15 minutes of work and go from there.&rdquo;

Set a timer and just do it.

If I have a task that needs to be done I try to envision the consequences of not doing said task. If I don’t study? I’ll more than likely get a bad grade. Don’t feel like doing laundry? Might not have clean underwear in a couple of days.

Like I said, it’s not the best way to motivate myself to do something but I find, for me at least, it works more times than it doesn’t.

Not sure if that will help with procrastination, but it might help with motivation.
